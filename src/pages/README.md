# Pages Directory

Page-level components that represent routes in the application.

Each page is a top-level route component that may use layouts and feature components.

## Naming Convention

- Use PascalCase for page components (e.g., `HomePage.tsx`, `AboutPage.tsx`)
- Each page should be in its own folder with kebab-case naming
